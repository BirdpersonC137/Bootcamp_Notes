// Go to the Johnny Five Javascript library's Githup repo.

// - Change the text color of all file name and directory name links to red.
document.querySelectorAll('.js-navigation-item > a').style.color = 'red'
// - Delete all file and directory icons from the file explorer (the big box below the Clone or download button).

// - Clone the johnny five logo (the big yellow square with a robot inside) and use it to replace the Github logo at the very top left of the page. Also, resize the cloned johnny five logo to be about the same size as the replaced Github logo.

// - Replace all topic tags (e.g. javascript, arduino, chip. etc) with the first tags, javascript
