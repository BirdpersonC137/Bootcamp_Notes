Does it include "C"? Next Module

Write a code that takes user's input and then prints out "Yes it has C" if entered input contains the letter "C" (upper or lower case). And it prints "There is no C" if it doesn't.

puts "Give me a awesome sentence: "
sentence = gets.chomp


letterArray = ['a', .., 'Z']
lines = 1
for letters in 'a'..'z'
  lines.times { print letters }
  puts ""
  lines += 1
  # for i in 0..x
  #   print let
  # end
  # puts
  # " "
  # x=x+1
end

# puts "Give me a sentence: "
