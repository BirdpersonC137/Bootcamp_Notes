/*Why Flexbox*/
*{display: flex;}
/*Great for mobile layouts*/
/*Great for little components that are apart of the page*/
/*Will manage the white space between elements for you*/

/*Important to Realize:*/
/*The element whose display is set to flex is named flex container.*/
  /*- only need to put it on the container where you want to manage its layout*/
  /*- its children are named flex items*/
    /*-flex items can also be containers*/
  /*- will only affect its children, not children of children*/

/*CSS properties are split between the container and its items*/

/* Some flex container properties:
flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, etc */

/*Flex Items*/
/*Have properties as well.
order, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, align-self*/
