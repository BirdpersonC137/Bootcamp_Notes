A class is something you can use to create an object

ex Cookie Cutter - used to make many cookies
ex Blueprint - used to make the same house

To define a class in Ruby, we use the reserved 'class' keyword and then we give the class name. The class name must be a constant, meaning that it must start with a capital letter.

class Cookies
end

load './cookie.rb'
c1 = Cookie.new
c2 = Cookie.new
c1.class #Cookie
name - "Tam"
name.class # string
a = String.new # ""
a.class # string
info = { name: "Tam"} # {:name => "Tam"}
my_hash = Hash.new('NOT PROVIDED')
my_hash(:city) # 'NOT PROVIDED'

if you have multiple class names - the convention is to use CamelCase

c. + <tab> <tab>
